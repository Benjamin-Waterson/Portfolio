			Transcription: “Hey Joe” — Mitch Mitchell with Jimi Hendrix		
		</h1>
		<hr>
		<p><i>Posted on March 7, 2021</i></p>

		<p>		
			Yeah, I should probably know better than to talk about “Hey Joe” in the 21st century. But there’s no denying that it’s an incredible song, despite the rather… <i>disturbing</i> lyrics.
		</p>

		<p>		
			There’s actually some interesting speculation online as to why Jimi decided to make his debut single a cover song about a man who murders his wife and tries to hightail it to Mexico. Discussions usually reference Jimi’s turbulent military service (e.g. being conscripted into the Army and basically kicked out of it) as possibly drawing him to a song about violence, betrayal, and freedom. I’ve even found comments about how the background vocals are meant to represent the ghost of Joe’s wife, haunting over him as he tries to cheat the gallows. <a href="../../blog/hey-joe/hey-joe.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

		“Advanced” Music Theory (For Drummers)

		<p>		
			In my <a href="../../blog/unpopular-opinions/unpopular-opinions.html">Unpopular Opinions post</a>, I brought up my frustration with drummers throwing around “advanced” music theory terms to look cool, without really investigating these terms mean. I said in that post that there was a chance I would write about this in the future, and here we are. I have four topics to discuss: syncopation, polyrhythm, polymeter, and metric modulation. I want to share my understanding of what these terms mean, and I’ll try to address what seems to be the omnipresent confusion regarding them. <a href="../../blog/advanced-music-theory/advanced-music-theory.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			So, a few weeks ago, someone on r/drums started <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/drums/comments/kzjmnq/whats_a_drumming_opinion_to_get_you_shunned/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3" target="_blank">a thread</a> basically asking about unpopular drum opinions. I couldn’t help myself, and I left quite a lengthy comment, since I find myself disagreeing with most of what happens on the internet with regards to drumming.

			If you’re like me and you’ve ever made the mistake of watching <i>Whiplash</i>, you probably sent your palm through your forehead at <a href="https://youtu.be/xDAsABdkWSc?t=155" target="_blank">the bit</a> where Fletcher points to a metronome marking and tells Andrew to “count me a 215” before he starts going on about “I am to understand that you cannot read tempo?!”. He also calls Andrew a retard, because edgy movie is edgy. If only I knew that the film was just getting started… (more thoughts on that <a href="../../blog/whiplash/whiplash.html" target="_blank">here</a>).

			Well, despite the fact that “read tempo” is a phrase that I’ve never heard a real musician use, you can indeed develop a skill like this. <a href="../../blog/know-your-tempos-led-zeppelin/know-your-tempos-led-zeppelin.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			I wanted to make a short post discussing my notation software of choice, MuseScore, since a somewhat <a href="https://musescore.org/en/3.6" target="_blank">significant update</a> just came out at the end of last week. The MuseScore team calls it an “engraving” release, adding some neat features such as default indenting on scores (which I previously always did with a spacer), in addition to a feature that will organize instruments on a conductor score (using templates such as “Orchestra” or “Jazz Band”). Perhaps most significantly, a new music font was added, “Leland”. <a href="../../blog/musescore-3.6/musescore-3.6.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Yeah yeah, this song’s been done dozens of times, but I took a shot at it a few years ago and I figured I’d share it. “Feeling This” is often considered a modern day drumming classic — it’s not hard to see why. “Feeling This” is one of the best songs Blink-182 ever did; just listen to the ending vocals <a href="../../../audio/blog/feeling-this/feeling-this-vocal-ending.m4a" target="_blank">in isolation</a> to see the band’s Studio Magic<sup>TM</sup> at work. <a href="../../blog/feeling-this/feeling-this.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			I know we just looked at Jason McGerr back in November, but when else am I gonna share a song called “The New Year”? So then, I have some more Jason McGerr groovage for you. The tune is off of Death Cab for Cutie’s masterpiece <i>Transatlaticism</i>, an album so good even Pitchfork realized they had fucked up when they <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18656-death-cab-for-cutie-transatlanticism/" target="_blank">revisited</a> the LP ten years later, bumping their original score from a 6.4 to an 8.4. <a href="../../blog/the-new-year/the-new-year.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>
