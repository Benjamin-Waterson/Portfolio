		Transcription: "Time Check" — Gregg Bisonette with The Buddy Rich Big Band

			This is part 2 of my posts concerning the 1989 Buddy Rich Memorial Scholarship concert. Today, we’re looking at Gregg Bisonette’s playing from “Time Check”; Gregg did a fantastic job that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/_loihfsCg6Y" target="_blank">His playing on “In A Mellow Tone”</a> swings harder than almost anything else from the show, and he goes very hard on this chart.

It’s a night that I consider to be one of the greatest moments in drumming history. Shamefully, it’s difficult to get a personal copy of the show; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Buddy-Memorial-Scholarship-Concerts-Two-Disc/dp/B000GRUQO2" target="_blank">DVD’s</a> haven’t been made since a limited run in 2006 (and as such are obnoxiously expensive), while only snippets are available on YouTube. <a href="../../blog/keep-the-customer-satisfied/keep-the-customer-satisfied.html"><i>Read More. . .</i></a>

			This has been kicking around in my drafts folder for almost exactly one year — I guess now is as good of a time as any to share it with the world. So, last October I saw a post over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/drums/" target="_blank">r/Drums</a> where somebody <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/drums/comments/dfokjs/can_someone_explain_what_is_rhythmically/" target="_blank">asked about</a> the Chon track “Story” off of their 2015 debut. The poster was asking about what was going on at the end of the tune, around the 3:10 mark. <a href="../../blog/story/story.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			What you’re hearing is a guy named Ryo Fukui (福居良). He began his life in music by playing the accordion (like all of us), and then at the age of 22 decided he wanted to be a jazz pianist. And after 6 years of self-taught instruction, he cut his first album, <i>Scenery</i>. <a href="../../blog/early-summer/early-summer.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			It’s finally time for some Keith Moon, the man who got me into drumming. I think Live at Leeds is one of the most important albums for any drummer to listen to, myself especially. I expect that one of these days I’ll take a look at the record; I’m even tempted to do a full note-for-note transcription of it…

		About four years ago, David Garibaldi released <a href="https://www.alfred.com/off-the-record/p/00-41239/" target="_blank">a collection of sheet music</a>, transcriptions he made himself to show off his playing with Tower of Power. I really like it when drummers take a look at their own playing, it’s the best look you’ll probably get at their work. I have the book myself, and it’s a great look at some very busy, dense/harmonic funk drumming. Garibaldi has some nutty drum parts. <a href="../../blog/the-price/the-price.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

		<p>
			I’m analyzing a bit of a deep cut, from their oft-forgotten second album <i>Weightless</i> (2011). I wasn’t tuned into Animals as Leaders when it came out, and while I suspect it got the attention it deserves when it was first released, it seems to be overlooked now. <a href="../../blog/odessa/odessa.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			This week, I’m sharing my interpretation of a drumming classic: “Aja” by Steely Dan, with Steve Gadd on drums. I couldn’t gush over this whole record enough, like many drummers and musicians have. But in all seriousness, <i>Aja</i> is one of the most important albums for me as a drummer, and Steve’s solo is one of those moments that totally changes the way you look at the instrument. <a href="../../blog/aja/aja.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Coming at you this week with a full song transcription: “Little Wing” by Jimi Hendrix.
		</p>

		<p>
			I really got into Hendrix during the spring semester of my senior year in high school, and as I dove into Mitch’s playing, I poked around online for some drum sheet music. This was back when I assumed the average drummer on the internet knew what they were doing when it came to transcribing (or really when it came to anything). <a href="../../blog/little-wing/little-wing.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

		<p>
			Welcome to the blog! I have a lot of things to share on my site, and I’ll kick things off with sheet music for the classic “Good Times Bad Times”. Most of the really famous licks are pretty well known, but since it’s such a revered tune I took a detailed look. I don’t have a lot of full-length transcriptions, but with songs like this that are under 3 minutes, it’s not too difficult. <a href="../../blog/good-times-bad-times/good-times-bad-times.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>
