		Transcription: “Ten Years Gone” — John Bonham with Led Zeppelin

			I probably have 12 or so full–length transcriptions laying around in a WIP folder that I haven’t shared yet, and I’m not really sure if I ever will. At least not in their current form, since note–for–note drum sheet music for an entire track often isn’t necessary. But today, I decided to share my interpretation of Led Zeppelin’s “Ten Years Gone”. I know, a full song! How exciting.

			Like “How Many More Times”, this was a Zeppelin song that escaped me for a few years after I first got into the band. I really never gave this track a proper listen until right after I graduated high school. And I must say, the tune is one of Zeppelin’s most engaging and emotional. <a href="../../blog/ten-years-gone/ten-years-gone.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Another sleepy post this week: I don’t have much to add about this tune, I just wanted to get my interpretation down on paper, since (surprisingly) there aren’t many transcriptions of this solo out there. <a href="../../blog/rock-and-roll/rock-and-roll.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Happy Holidays everyone! This week, I decided to share something I started a while back and have spent some time polishing up: fills and solos from “How Many More Times” off of Led Zeppelin’s debut album, with John Bonham on drums.
		</p>
		<p>
			I think it’s appropriate to close out my first year on the site with this tune. The project was actually the first “big time” transcription of a song I ever attempted, starting way back in the summer of 2014. <a href="../../blog/how-many-more-times/how-many-more-times.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Transcription: “Good Times Bad Times” — John Bonham with Led Zeppelin

			Welcome to the blog! I have a lot of things to share on my site, and I’ll kick things off with sheet music for the classic “Good Times Bad Times”. Most of the really famous licks are pretty well–known, but since it’s such a revered tune I took a detailed look. I don’t have a lot of full–length transcriptions, but with songs like this that are under three minutes, it’s not too difficult. <a href="../../blog/good-times-bad-times/good-times-bad-times.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>
