			Yeah, I should probably know better than to talk about “Hey Joe” in the 21st century. But there’s no denying that it’s an incredible song, despite the rather… <i>disturbing</i> lyrics.
		</p>

		<p>		
			There’s actually some interesting speculation online as to why Jimi decided to make his debut single a cover song about a man who murders his wife and tries to hightail it to Mexico. Discussions usually reference Jimi’s turbulent military service (i.e.  being conscripted into the Army and basically kicked out of it) as possibly drawing him to a song about violence, betrayal, and freedom. I’ve even found comments about how the background vocals are meant to represent the ghost of Joe’s wife, haunting over him as he tries to cheat the gallows. <a href="../../blog/hey-joe/hey-joe.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Coming at you this week with a full song transcription: “Little Wing” by Jimi Hendrix.
		</p>

		<p>
			I really got into Hendrix during the spring semester of my senior year in high school, and as I dove into Mitch’s playing, I poked around online for some drum sheet music. This was back when I assumed the average drummer on the internet knew what they were doing when it came to transcribing (or really when it came to anything). <a href="../../blog/little-wing/little-wing.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>
