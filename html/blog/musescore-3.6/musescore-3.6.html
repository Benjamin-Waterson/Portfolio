		<h1>MuseScore 3.6 Released</h1>
		<div class="full-row">

		<img src="../../../images/blog/musescore-3.6/musescore-3.6-summary.png" alt="MuseScore 3.6 Summary" id="summary-image">	
		
		<p>		
			I wanted to make a short post discussing my notation software of choice, MuseScore, since a somewhat <a href="https://musescore.org/en/3.6" target="_blank">significant update</a> just came out at the end of last week. The MuseScore team calls it an “engraving” release, adding some neat features such as default indenting on scores (which I previously always did with a spacer), in addition to a feature that will organize instruments on a conductor score (using templates such as “Orchestra” or “Jazz Band”). Perhaps most significantly, a new music font was added, “Leland”.
		</p>
		<p>
			Music fonts change the appearance of the actual music on the paper, and for a long time, MuseScore users (like myself) looked to Finale and Sibelius with a bit of envy, as these programs have many options for music fonts. When I started using MuseScore (ver 1.3), there were only three fonts available: Emmentaler (the same font <a href="http://lilypond.org" target="_blank">Lilypond</a> uses), Bravura (created for <a href="https://new.steinberg.net/dorico/" target="_blank">Dorico</a>), and Gonville (built by software developer <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/gonville/" target="_blank">Ian Jackson</a>, and based off of Emmentaler). 
		</p>

		<p>
			After 5 years of discussion, MuseScore finally implemented a lead-sheet style font called MuseJazz, which until now was the only music font update. The developers have explained that music fonts must be built into MuseScore to be used, meaning the also have to have the appropriate license. So most of these third party fonts can’t be used. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Leland is meant to be MuseScore’s new default. It takes its inspiration from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCORE_(software)" target="_blank">SCORE</a>, an increasingly obscure scorewriter created by Leland Smith in the 80’s — it actually predates Finale by 1 year, and it seems to be the first scorewriter to get any professional use (even well into the 21st century). However, Smith apparently made the decision that when he would die, SCORE would die with him; he <a href="https://www.scoringnotes.com/news/leland-smith-dies-at-88/" target="_blank">passed away</a> in December of 2013 and SCORE hasn’t been updated since. The <a href="http://scoremus.com" target="_blank">website</a> is kaput and software has been basically deserted.
		</p>

		<p>
			Smith spent a lot of time investigating how real engraving works (i.e. the poor folks who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvyoKdW-Big" target="_blank">carve notation</a> backwards into metal), so the program quickly became esteemed for its output. MuseScore head of design Martin Keary work with professional engraving Simon Smith (a long time SCORE user) to build the new font. Here’s a random ditty I cooked up to show off the new update:

			At first glance, I really like the look of the time signatures, dynamics, and accents. However, I find the X noteheads to be a little thin — I feel like they get drowned out by the normal noteheads. The china cymbal notehead looks a bit small too. The parentheses I use for ghost notes also look too small and are hard to catch. Meanwhile, the “marcato” accents look a bit wide for me, and there’s just something off about the rest for eight notes and up. Again, they look thin and wispy. 
		</p>

		<p>
			There’s also something funny going with the flags. I noticed it most with the flam grace note (acciaccatura). When I push the grace note closer to the anchor note, the flag gets way too close to the notehead. There’s more space by default, but I always get ride of it because the space doesn’t look good to me. Heres the same excerpt in cleaned up with Emmentaler:

		<p>
			I think I’ll stick with Emmentaler for now. I do admire the work that went into this; the more of these fonts MuseScore has, the better. They can go a long way to give score some personality.
		</p>
		<p>
			I still have to make some routine adjustments to make the score look good: adding space to ghost note parentheses, pushing flams closer to main notes, fixing weird stem lengths, and fixing tuplet brackets with crazy slopes (sadly, there’s still no way to force horizontal on tuplets brackets). I guess I’ll have to hold out for MuseScore 4.
		</p>
		<p>
			Lastly, the team added a new default typeface called Edwin, based on New Century Schoolbook. Since I labored over what typface would look good on my site as well as my scores (not to mention the all typefaces I found for tuplets and the like), I’m not sure if and when I’ll use it. It does look nice for chord symbols, so I’m tempted to replace Bitstream Charter, my current typeface. I think the bold font is way too heavy however, so we’ll see…
