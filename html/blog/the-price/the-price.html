		A few years ago, David Garibaldi released <a href="https://www.alfred.com/off-the-record/p/00-41239/" target="_blank">a collection of sheet music</a>, transcriptions he made himself of his playing with Tower of Power. I really like it when drummers take a look at their own playing, it’s the best look you’ll probably get at their work. I have the book myself, and it’s a great look at some very busy, dense/harmonic funk drumming. Garibaldi has some nutty drum parts.

		Some time before I got the book, I took a listen through David’s discography with TOP. I noticed a cool little moment from the first album <i>East Bay Grease</i>, where David exchanges 2 bars solos with guitarist Willy Fulton at the of the track “The Price”. <i>East Bay Grease</i> is a really interesting album; it sounds nothing like any other TOP record, and sounds closer to an R&B album than a funk/fusion one, in terms of style and production. There are a lot of fun moments, although many of the tunes have a tendency to devolve into drawn out jams. You can tell it was their first LP. The big exception is the closer, “Sparkling in The Sand”. It’s a very pensive, forlorn tune driven by Skip Mesquite’s flute.

		Anyway, there’re are some neat moves on this little solo section. A lot of ghost notes, hi hat barks, and nimble tom work. The most exciting fill is perhaps in the 6th line — I included the stickings so you’d know how to play it. The secret is a lefthand paradiddle-diddle starting on beat 4:

		Also involving paradiddle-diddles are the 32nd notes that we see at the start of the second page:

		Take note of the China cymbal; at 1970, this is the earliest use of a China cymbal I know of.
