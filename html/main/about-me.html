		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<section class="full-row">
			<p>
				My name is Benjamin Waterson. I recently finished up five years at CU Boulder, studying psychology, music, and TAM (technology, arts, and media). I grew up near Oakland, California, and I currently live near Boulder, Colorado. I'm primarily a drumset player, but I also have experience with piano and alto saxophone. I played alto in the CU marching band for 4 years, and I played drumset in the CU basketball for 4 years as well. Nowadays I play drums for Just Another Mountain Band and record drum tracks out of a home studio here in Colorado. I update my blog every Sunday, be sure to check it out!

			<h2>More Info:</h2>

			<h4>
				How long have you been playing music for?
			</h4>
			<p>
				All in all, about 18 years. I took piano lessons for a few years when I was real young, starting around age 6. I had my first drum lesson in August of 2005 at the age of 8, and I had private instruction for exactly ten years — my final lesson was when I moved out in August of 2015. I picked up the sax when I started college that year, and the rest is history. In fact, I’m getting misty-eyed just thinking about it. 
			</p>

			<h4>
				What kind of drums do you play?
			</h4>
			<p>
				I have a Pearl set for the studio, although sadly Pearl doesn’t make the exact model anymore… such is life. This kit has Sabian cymbals, and I always use Remo heads and Vic Firth sticks. I have a variety of doodads from LP and Index Drums. I use DW hardware — when I can afford it. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				If you see me drum live, you’ll probably spot me with an old Ludwig kit I got for out of the house playing. I fitted this one with some second hand Zildjian cymbals.
			</p>

			<h4>
				What DAW do you use?
			</h4>
			<p>
				I do pretty much everything in Logic Pro. I also make good use of Max Signal Processing, a bit of SuperCollider, and the amazing PaulStretch. I have Isotope’s Rx7 if I need it, as well as the plugins that came with my UA interface (like fancy compressors and oxidizers). Most of the time, I just use what’s built into Logic. Oh, I also have Audacity, like everyone else.
			</p>

			<h4>
				What do you use to create music notation?
			</h4>
			<p>
				I use MuseScore for all my transcribing/engraving. It’s pretty glitchy, but with a bit of patience, I can pretty much do anything I want. I really admire the commitment the developers have to maintain MuseScore while keeping it free; I have no reason to shell out for Finale or Sibelius.
			</p>

			<h4>
				Who are your favorite drummers?
			</h4>
			<p>
				For first place, we have a tie between John Bonham and Keith Moon. There’s about a 30 way tie for second place…
			</p>

			<h4>
				What has been your most difficult transcription?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Right now, probably Tommy Igoe’s solo from “Jazz Crimes”, off of the 2014 album <i>The Tommy Igoe Groove Conspiracy</i>. I haven’t shared it yet because it needs several more hours of proofreading. It'll show up sometime early next year. Until then, stay tuned…
