<h4>Lyrics:</h4>
<h5>1. “Natural Born Killer” (5:40)</h5>
<p class="lyrics">
Natural born killer <br>
Never doing what you’re told <br>
Natural born killer <br>
Leaving me out in the cold <br>
I gotta ask why <br>
Why oh why oh why… <br>
Natural born killer <br>
She’s never satisfied <br>
Natural born killer <br>
I’ve seen this a million times <br>
I gotta ask why <br>
Why oh why… <br>
<br>
Oh, baby, doing that thing you do <br>
that thing you do <br> 
Oh, baby, doing that thing you do <br>
that thing you do <br> 
<br>
Natural born killer, <br> 
Natural born killer <br>
I can see it in your eyes <br>
I’m in for a suprise<br>
Natural born killer,  <br>
Natural born killer <br>
I see your face all over town<br>
Makes me so angry! <br>
Makes me so sad! <br>
<br>
Natural born killer <br>
Always looking for that thrill <br>
Natural born killer <br>
No she just can’t stand still <br>
I gotta ask why <br>
Why oh why oh why… <br>
Natural born killer <br>
She’s walking out that door <br>
Natural born killer <br>
Always asking for more <br>
I gotta ask why <br>
Why oh why oh why… <br>
<br>
Oh, doing that thing you do <br>
Oh, doing that thing you do <br>
<br>
Natural born killer, <br> 
Natural born killer <br>
I can see it in your eyes <br>
I’m in for a suprise<br>
Natural born killer,  <br>
Natural born killer <br>
I look into your eyes <br>
Makes me so angry! <br>
Makes me so sad! <br>

<h5>2. “Take Me Back” (4:16)</h5>
<p class="lyrics">
Take me back! To the Fatherland. <br>
Take me back! To the Mothership. <br>
<br>
Take me back to the one that I feel  <br>
Is this fake or is this real?  <br>
Got to want to hear the warning call  <br>
All for one and one for all! <br> 
Give her the moment of the rolling stone <br> 
Kiss me so sweet I’m going to take you home.  <br>
We can go far, far from being alone  <br>
Up in the stars it gets cold to the bone  <br>
<br>
Running . . .  yes I’m<br>
Running . . .  yes I’m<br>
Running . . .  yes I’m<br>
Running, running, running . . . <br>
Running, running, running . . . <br>
Oh yeah <br>
<br>
Take me back! To the Fatherland. <br>
Take me back! To the Mothership. <br>
<br>
Take me back to where I once called home  <br>
Let me loose and let me roam <br>
Lord knows it ain’t perfect here <br>
Do you choose love or do you choose fear? <br>
So much growth, but at what cost?  <br>
Do you feel found or do you feel lost? <br>
Chase your tail to be gratified  <br>
Look long term to be satisfied,  <br>
Yes why I'm running <br>
<br>
Running . . . yes I’m <br>
Running . . . yes I’m <br>
Running . . . yes I’m  <br>
Running, running, running . . . <br>
Running, running, running . . . <br>
Oh yeah <br>
<br>
Running . . .  <br>
Running . . .  <br>
Running . . .  <br>
Running, running, running . . . <br>
Running, running, running . . . <br>
Oh yeah <br>
</p>

<h5>3. “Daydream” (4:59)</h5>
<p class="lyrics">
Can’t you feel your persuasion? <br>
Day by day <br>
Life is worth the pursuit <br>
Don’t you let it slip away <br>
Whatever you’ve given a try never deserves regret  <br>
There’s magic in desire <br>
That is why I let, myself...  <br>
<br>
Daydream, I like what I see  <br>
If my time don’t come today <br>
then my work will pave the way  <br>
Daydream, I like what I see <br>
When I overcome my past then I build my base to last <br>
<br>
Soar over the forest <br>
high above the trees <br>
There’s safety in the fortress <br>
open up and feel the breeze <br>
Throw caution to the wind <br>
to grow scatter the seeds <br>
The fruit is on the limb <br>
The juice is worth the squeeze, so I...  <br>
<br>
Daydream, I like what I see  <br>
If my time don’t come today <br>
then my work will pave the way  <br>
Daydream, I like what I see <br>
When I overcome my past then I build my base to last <br>
<br>
Daydream, I like what I see  <br>
If my time don’t come today <br>
then my work will pave the way  <br>
Daydream, I like what I see <br>
When I overcome my past then I build my base to last <br>

<h5>3. “Paradise” (8:00)</h5>
<p class="lyrics">
Paradise! Come on!<br>
Yeah it’s gonna feel nice <br>
We’re living in a Paradise! Come on!<br>
No need to think twice <br>
<br>
Welcome to the Paradise! Come on! <br>
Oh yeah, I’m gonna feel so nice... you can too<br>
We’re living in a Paradise! Come On! <br>
No need to think twice <br>
<br>
You’ve got to move up on the ladder <br>
Even if you feel like it doesn’t matter <br>
I’ve scraped on by for a long long time <br>
Top looking down it was all worth the climb <br> 
Seeking and searching long long and hard  <br>
You’re gonna be beat down if you don’t follow your heart  <br>
Living ain’t easy when you can’t get enough  <br>
And it feels so rough <br>
<br>
Paradise! Come on!<br>
Yeah it’s gonna feel nice <br>
We’re living in a Paradise! Come on!<br>
No need to think twice <br>
<br>
<br>
Listen to that part of yourself <br>
Feel good, focus on your health <br>
your wealth, your breath, your well–being  <br>
You start to be it when you see it clearly!  <br>
I give it to you, you give it to me <br>
That’s a little part of charity <br>
Instead of one on one, <br>
we go hand-in-hand <br>
You gotta understand <br>
Every woman and man <br>
We get down! <br>
<br>
You got what you need... <br>
Yes you got what you need... <br>
Yes you got what you need... <br>
Paradise... <br>
I was looking for you  <br>
Paradise... <br>
At last it comes true! <br>
In paradise... <br>
At last it comes true... <br>
<br>
Paradise! Come on!<br>
Oh yeah it’s going to feel nice... you can too <br>
We’re living in a Paradise! Come on!<br>
No need to think twice <br>
<br>
Don’t build up a hurry <br>
Be content on your own <br>
We can go on a journey <br>
if you’re coming along <br>
We’re lost in the desert <br>
for millions of miles. <br>
To grow with every effort <br>
makes you smile for a while <br>
Live and never dilly dally <br>
Climb through all the peaks and the valleys  <br>
We live our best life at large <br>
Create the plan, baby make the charge <br>
<br>
Welcome to the Paradise! Come on!<br>
Yeah I’m gonna feel nice <br>
We’re living in a Paradise! Come on!<br>
Oh Yeah, I’m gonna feel nice <br>
<br>
Welcome to the Paradise! Come on!<br>
Oh Yeah, I’m gonna feel nice <br>
We’re living in a Paradise! Come on!<br>
Oh Yeah, I’m gonna feel nice... you can too<br>
